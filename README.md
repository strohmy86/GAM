# GAM
Front End Python program for GAM by Jay Lee

**_You must first install and configure [https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM "GAM by Jay Lee"]_**. I have included the installer for Gam and python in the [https://github.com/strohmy86/GAM/releases "Release"].

This Python program is written in Python 3 and assumes that you are running Linux with the default install location **_(~/bin/gam/)_** for GAM. If your environment is different, you will need to change the code to meet your needs.

This program does not yet contain all of GAM's capabilities, but I am regularly adding functionality. Check back often for updates and added features.

I am always looking for suggestions. Please feel free to add your suggestions for features that are not yet included in this program.
